        <li><h4>Definition</h4></li>
        <p>
            Orange roses are vibrant, warm-colored roses that range from peach to deep orange. They stand out for their lively, fiery appearance and are a relatively recent addition to the world of roses, blending the passion of red roses and the warmth of yellow roses.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Scientific Name</h4></li>
        <p>
            Rosa spp. Many orange roses are hybrid cultivars, resulting from crossbreeding red and yellow roses. Notable examples include varieties like Rosa 'Tropicana', Rosa 'Marina', and Rosa 'Vavoom'.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Country of Origin</h4></li>
        <p>
            Orange roses are the result of hybridization, first developed in the mid-20th century by rose breeders, mainly in the United States and Europe. By selectively breeding red and yellow roses, breeders created new roses with vibrant shades of orange that previously didn't exist in nature.
        </p>

    <h2 class="sofadi" id="blue">Blue Roses: Overview</h2>
    <div class="image"><img src="img/blue rose.img" alt="blue roses" class="blue-rose"></div>
    <ul class="sofadi">
        <li><h4>Definition</h4></li>
        <p>
            Blue roses are roses with a blue or blue-violet hue, often regarded as symbols of the impossible or unattainable. True blue roses do not occur naturally, as roses lack the genetic ability to produce blue pigment. Most blue roses seen today are either white roses dyed blue or genetically engineered.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Scientific Name</h4></li>
        <p>
            Since natural blue roses do not exist within the Rosa genus, there is no specific species name for a blue rose. Some of the blue-tinted roses available are cultivars created through genetic engineering, such as the Suntory Blue Rose "Applause" created by the Japanese company Suntory.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Country of Origin</h4></li>
        <p>
            Blue roses, in their modern form, were first developed in Japan by the company Suntory in 2004 after many years of genetic research. The company used genetic engineering to introduce blue pigment from other flowers, creating a rose with a lavender-blue shade.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Meanings and Symbolism</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Mystery & Enigma: Blue roses are symbols of mystery and intrigue, often representing something beyond reach or understanding.</li>
            <li>The Impossible & Unattainable: Because blue roses don't naturally exist, they are seen as symbols of the unattainable or something that cannot be achieved.</li>
            <li>Hope & Desire: Blue roses can represent a longing or wish for something unlikely to happen, embodying the hope for miracles or dreams coming true.</li>
            <li>Uniqueness & Individuality: Given their rarity, blue roses are sometimes used to express uniqueness or admiration for an exceptional person.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>History</h4></li>
        <p>
            The idea of blue roses has fascinated people for centuries, and they have appeared in art, literature, and folklore as symbols of mystery and longing. For centuries, horticulturists tried to cultivate blue roses through traditional breeding methods, but without success. In 2004, after more than a decade of research, the Japanese company Suntory succeeded in creating a blue-tinted rose by inserting a gene from a blue-flowering plant, marking the first genetically modified “blue” rose, although the color was more lavender than true blue.

        <li><h4>Definition</h4></li>
        <p>
            Multi-colored roses, also known as "rainbow roses" or "tie-dye roses," are roses with petals of multiple colors, often in vibrant and contrasting hues. They are created either by dyeing white roses or by cultivating hybrid varieties that naturally produce multiple colors. Multi-colored roses are eye-catching and are especially popular in unique floral arrangements.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Scientific Name</h4></li>
        <p>
            Rosa spp. Naturally multi-colored roses are hybrids within the Rosa genus, such as Rosa 'Abracadabra', Rosa 'Candy Stripe', and Rosa 'Double Delight', which naturally exhibit blended or variegated colors. Rainbow roses, however, are often artificially dyed.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Country of Origin</h4></li>
        <p>
            The practice of dyeing roses to create rainbow colors originated in the Netherlands.

            Naturally occurring multi-colored roses, like striped and variegated varieties, have been cultivated for centuries, with early examples appearing in 19th-century Europe. Hybridization techniques allowed breeders to create roses with naturally variegated petals, such as red and white or yellow and pink blends, often through crossbreeding different rose species.
