    <h1>Welcome to Rose Spectrum!</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Lalyn L. Mangubat, an 18-year-old first-year college student at the University of Cebu Main Campus, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Outside of academics, I find joy in drawing, painting, and creating arts and crafts at home.

        I'm also deeply fascinated by the beauty, history, and science of roses. This website is my space to share my journey as I explore the incredible variety and stories behind rosesâ€”from rare species to the colors and unique meanings each rose holds.
    </p>

    <p>I created this website not just because of a love for flowers, but because there's a special someone in my life who reminds me of roses. Their presence, like a rose, is both beautiful and meaningful, inspiring me to look deeper into the world of roses and what they symbolize.</p>

    <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey through the "spectrum" of roses!</p>
